                  ======================
 Developed and maintained by Matthias Ettrich (ettrich@kde.org)


kstart is a tiny utility to launch legay applications with special KDE
window properties such as iconified, maximized, a certain virtual
desktop, a special decoration or sticky.

In addition, the -activate switch will jump to the window even if it
is started on a different virtual desktop.

Usage:

kstart <command> [-window <regular expression>] [-desktop <number>]
       [-sticky] [-iconify] [-maximize] [-decoration tiny|none] [-activate]

If you do not specify a regular expression for the windows title, then
the very first window to appear will be taken. Not recommended!

Example usage:
  kstart "xclock -geometry 80x80-0+0"  -window xclock -decoration tiny -sticky


kstart requires a KDE compliant windowmanager
.
Hope some people find this useful,
